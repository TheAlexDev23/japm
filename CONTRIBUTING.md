# Contributing guidelines

Before anything I want to thank you for considering contributing to this project.

## Creating packages

Packages are not stored in this repo, and in the time that I'm writing this, they are stored in the official [JAPM repo](https://github.com/TheAlexDev23/japm-official-packages)

If you want to create a package you need to follow the repos you want to post them into contributing guidelines.

## Contributing to JAPM / JAPML

There's many ways you can contribute to the project: creating issues, reporting bugs, creating pull requests, commenting about other contributions and generating discussions around them.

Before creating a pull request make sure that your code compiles and JAPM works as intended.
